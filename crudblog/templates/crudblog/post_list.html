            <p><img src="http://www.trivalleylifechurch.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/three-friends_cropped.jpg" alt="image missing" style="float:center; width:250px; height:250px;"><br />
                As promised,  we are back with a story.<br />
                ...<br />
                <span style="color:red">Hello, bro speak up. Am I audible?". <br />
                "Did he listened?" <br />
                "<i>Nah, marega sala wo, main bata rha hu tujhe</i>" <br />
                This conversation of Rohit and Karan brought a lot of questions in Mayank's innocent mind.<br />
                He asked Karan, "can't we four have a vis-a-vis?". Rohit grawled at him, "didn't you heard him?" <br />
                "We are going to meet her, tomorrow." </span><br />
            ...to be continued.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1><span style="color:blue"><del> 4 friends</del> <ins>  3 friends</ins>.</span></h1>
            <p>published: 19.08.2018, 11:50</p>
            <p>auther: anonymous</p>
            <p><span style="color:red">...<br />
                So all this started from that phone call, in which Karan told Harshita that he liked her.<br />
                That call changed everything, friendships, bonds and eventually paved the way for high end cut-class <i>bakchodi</i>.<br />
                The next day, when Karan arrived school, he felt a totally different atmosphere. He could not understand<br />
                why everyone was staring at him. Some even congratulated him. He was very puzzeled. His brain was asking just one <br />
                thing, "WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?". He started thinkig of any possible clue of this atmosphere in the past, but got none.<br />
                In between querries and congratulations, he spotted Aditya. As expected, he spilled his very first statement,<br />
                 "<i>bhai, apne bhai k sath aisa krega? Bina koi khabar bandi pata liya? Party kab dega?</i>"  <br />
                 "<b>Seriously??? was this that big issue?</b>", Karan asked himself. He excused himself from Aditya <br >
                 saying, "treat will be soon".<br />
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 As Karan entered the class, the first person he saw was her. He asked Harshita, "we were supposed to disclose this together".<br />
                 Harshita nodded and with an innocent smile said that she only told Shikha about this, but it just got viral.<br />
                 That day was passed gossiping on this topic only. The main dabate was about to come when the three friends were going to meet. <br />
                 <br />
                 <br /></span>
